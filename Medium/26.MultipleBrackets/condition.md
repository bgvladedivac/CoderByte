# Challenge
Have the function MultipleBrackets(str) take the str parameter being passed and return 1 #ofBrackets if the brackets are correctly matched and each one is accounted for. Otherwise return 0. For example: if str is "(hello [world])(!)", then the output should be 1 3 because all the brackets are matched and there are 3 pairs of brackets, but if str is "((hello [world])" the the output should be 0 because the brackets do not correctly match up. Only "(", ")", "[", and "]" will be used as brackets. If str contains no brackets return 1.
