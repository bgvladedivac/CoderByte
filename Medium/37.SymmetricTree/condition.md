# Challenge
Have the function SymmetricTree(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will represent a binary tree, and determine if the tree is symmetric (a mirror image of itself). The array will be implemented similar to how a binary heap is implemented, except the tree may not be complete and NULL nodes on any level of the tree will be represented with a #. For example: if strArr is ["1", "2", "2", "3", "#", "#", "3"] then this tree looks like the following: 

 

For the input above, your program should return the string true because the binary tree is symmetric.
