# Challenge
Have the function ABCheck(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string true if the characters a and b are separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once (ie. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b). Otherwise return the string false. 

# Sample Test Cases
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
Input:"after badly"
Output:"false"


Input:"Laura sobs"
Output:"true"
```
