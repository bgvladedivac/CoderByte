# Challenge
Using the Ruby language, have the function Palindrome(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the string true if the parameter is a palindrome, (the string is the same forward as it is backward) otherwise return the string false. For example: "racecar" is also "racecar" backwards. Punctuation and numbers will not be part of the string. 

# Sample Test Cases
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
Input:"never odd or even"
Output:"true"

Input:"eye"
Output:"true"
```
