# Challenge
Have the function BitwiseOne(strArr) take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will only contain two strings of equal length that represent binary numbers, and return a final binary string that performed the bitwise OR operation on both strings. A bitwise OR operation places a 0 in the new string where there are zeroes in both binary strings, otherwise it places a 1 in that spot. For example: if strArr is ["1001", "0100"] then your program should return the string "1101"
