# Challenge
Have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces. 
# Sample Test Cases
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}

Input:"No words"
Output:-1
```
